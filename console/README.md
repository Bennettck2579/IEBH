Every folder has certain javascript files in them. The action they do is represented by their names. 
None of them work with other gamemodes besides the one in which they are found.

To use them:
Step 1: Join a game of blooket and start the game
Step 2: Copy the contents of the .js file
Step 3: Open the inspect element tab within blooket (Ctrl + I for chrome, RMB + Q for firefox)
Step 4: Navigate to the console portion of the inspect element tab
Step 5: Paste the contents of the .js file into the console prompt.
Step 6: Enjoy!
